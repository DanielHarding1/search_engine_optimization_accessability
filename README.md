Accessability - 

Firstly this code is about editing inital code to allow for the increased accessability for users who need it.

The website shows the importance of search engine optimization, i have added semantic elements to the HTML file to allow for more structured code.

Furthermore, specifically for the increased accessability, i have included "alt" comments on pictures so that images can be decribed to the blind or visually impaired.
